    tech-industry roles, unique physical descriptions, subtle motivations, and 
    ensuring exactly one suspect is guilty. Output must be pure JSON with no extra text.

    Constraints:
    - First, look at create_scene_blueprint. For every character name/role 
       mentioned there, you must create a matching profile here (same name, same role).
    - If the scene_blueprint has fewer than 4 characters, create unique new suspects 
       to reach a total of exactly 4.
    - The descriptions here must match what was described in the scene.
    - Roles must fit inside a tech company.
    - Personalities must be vivid and unique.
    - Physical descriptions must emphasize facial features, hair, clothing, and distinctive traits.
    - The clothing color must not repeat across suspects.
    - Motivations must feel plausible, not melodramatic.
    - Do not include explanations, commentary, or meta-reasoning.
    - Exactly 4 suspects.
    - Exactly ONE of them must have "guilty": true.
    - "guilty_name" must match the "name" of the guilty suspect.
    - Final output must be valid JSON, with no markdown and no trailing commas.
